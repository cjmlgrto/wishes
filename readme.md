**Problem**: So you've organised a kris-kringle with your entire extended family. You already know who you're buying a gift for— *but you don't know what they want*! Also, you have an idea of *you yourself* want. You wanna make sure people are buying the right things for each other.

**Solution**: Wishes! This webapp is a shared family wishes manager that allows you to populate your own personal wishlist, and check what other people in your family want! *Bonus feature*— you can anonymously ‘cross off’ items in other people's wishlists, that way you can avoid duplicate gifts!
